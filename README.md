# Sunshine Example
This is a simple app that uses RxJava, Dagger, Retrofit to get data from openweather API

Openweathermap API requires to use API Key that has to be added to the request, like:
http://api.openweathermap.org/......&APPID={API_KEY}

In the tutorial below we assume you have the API Key and you append it to the url. You can obtain one by signing up at the [OpenWeatherMap website]( https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up "OpenWeatherMap website").

**Icons**: The weather icons font created by [Erik Flowers](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons). Copy [weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons/blob/master/fonts/weathericons-regular-webfont.ttf?raw=true) to your project's assets/fonts directory
